title: SFZ File Format
---
The SFZ file format is a human readable instrument definition file format for
audio sample based virtual instruments. In contrast to many other sampler file
formats you can open and modify such .sfz files simply with any text editor.

> This SFZ documentation is yet under construction. In the meantime you may want
to have a look at the old and currently still separate list of
[opcodes supported by LinuxSampler](http://linuxsampler.org/sfz/).
You want to help filling up the missing information about the SFZ file format
on this site? Great! Check out the [source files of this SFZ documentation](http://svn.linuxsampler.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/doc/docbase/sfz/)
on our Subversion server and [get in touch with us](http://linuxsampler.org/developers.html)!

## Sections

A sfz file is divided into sections. A section defines in which context the
subsequent statements in the sfz file shall be interpreted as. For example You
may want to declare a lowpass filter to be used either for the entire sfz
instrument, or you may declare the lowpass filter to be only used for a certain
region on the keyboard instead. A section is introduced by its section name,
where the section name is placed in a pair of angle brackets. The section name
is then followed by the respective sfz opcodes which shall be assigned to that
particular section. The sections available with sfz are:

| Section                      | Standard | Description
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -----------
| <[`global`](section/global)> | SFZ v1   | Declarations which shall apply to the entire instrument.
| <`group`>                    | SFZ v1   | TODO ...
| <`region`>                   | SFZ v1   | TODO ...
| <`control`>                  | ?        | TODO ...
| <`curve`>                    | ?        | TODO ...
| <`effect`>                   | ?        | TODO ...

## Opcodes

The actual individual statements which make up the articulation definition of a
sfz instrument are called opcodes. For example there is an opcode for loading and
assigning a sample file to be played. And there is an opcode for defining envelope
parameters, and so on. The opcodes available with the SFZ file format are:

| Section                             | Standard          | Description
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | -----------
| [hibend](opcode/hibend)             | SFZ v1            | Assign pitch pend upper limit to region.
| [hichan](opcode/hichan)             | SFZ v1            | Assign MIDI channel upper limit to region.
| [hikey](opcode/hikey)               | SFZ v1            | Assign MIDI note number upper limit to region.
