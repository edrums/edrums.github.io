## Here is the beta version of the schema and pcb:

[microDrum v0.7 Schematic](microDRUM_v0.7-Schematic.pdf)

[microDrum v0.7 PCB](microDRUM_v0.7-PCB.pdf)

[microDrum v0.7 Gerber](microDRUM_v0.7-Gerber.zip)

[microDrum Jack v0.4 Schematic](microDRUM_Jack_v0.4-Schematic.pdf)

[microDrum Jack v0.4 PCB](microDRUM_Jack_v0.4-PCB.pdf)

[microDrum LCD v0.1 Schematic](microDRUM_LCD_v0.1-Schematic.pdf)

[microDrum Box v1.1 Design](microDrumBox_v1.1.pdf)

## And here is the software, that is absolutely unstable and dangerous:

[microDrum Firmware v1.0](microDRUM_Firmware_v1.0.zip)

[microDrum ConfigTool v1.0](microDRUM_ConfigTool_v1.0.zip)

[DrumScope v0.1](DrumScope-v0.1.zip) To run the ConfigTool is required .NET
Framework v3.5 from Microsoft. To upload the firmware you can use the same
ConfigTool, for security should do so with Arduino connected with only USB, the
rest of microDrum must be disconnected.

[microDrum Python Executable for Windows v0.0](python_microdrum_exe.zip)
