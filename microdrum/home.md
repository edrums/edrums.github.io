### Welcome to microWiki!

MicroDRUM is the most economical and simple way to build MIDI drum trigger.
It’s based on [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) and can be used
with a huge variety of e-pads / e-cymbals, up to 48 inputs!
The output can be sent to a PC and converted to drum sounds through [VST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology)
like BFD, Addictive Drums and Superior Drummer, etc. …
The accompanying software allows features not found in any similar solution:
a direct interface with VST (without USB-MIDI cable), record, playback of
tablature to practice on, etc. … This is a Open Hardware product made in Italy!
